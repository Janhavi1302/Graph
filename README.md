# Data Visualization in Python

This repository demonstrates various data visualizations created using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

## Visualizations Included:

1. **Pie Chart**: A circular chart that illustrates the proportional composition of different categories.
2. **Bar Graph**: A graphical representation using rectangular bars to compare values across different categories or groups.
3. **Single Line Graph**: A graph that represents data trends or relationships between two variables over time.
4. **Double Line Graph**: A dual-line graph that compares two datasets, showing how each changes over the same period or variable.
5. **Scatter Plot**: A graph that uses dots to show the relationship between two variables, helping to identify correlations or patterns.
6. **Histogram**: A bar graph that represents the distribution of data points into specified ranges or intervals.

These visualizations offer a clear and intuitive way to analyze, interpret, and communicate data patterns and trends.
